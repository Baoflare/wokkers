types:
  PortRange:
    docs: >-
      Range of ports that can be connected to.

      If configured, `network_mode` must equal `host`.

      Port ranges may overlap between containers, it is the responsibility of the developer to ensure ports are available before using.

        docs: Unsigned 32 bit integer.
        type: integer
      max:
        docs: Unsigned 32 bit integer.
        type: integer

  PortProtocol:
    docs: >-
      Type of network traffic to allow access to this port.

      Configuring `https` or `tcp_tls` will provide TLS termination for you via Game Guard.

      `https` and `tcp_tls` must have `proxy_kind` set to `game_guard`.
    enum:
      - http
      - https
      - tcp
      - tcp_tls
      - udp

  ProxyKind:
    docs: >-
      Range of ports that can be connected to.

      `game_guard` (default) proxies all traffic through [Game Guard](https://rivet.gg/docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/game-guard) to mitigate DDoS attacks and provide TLS termination.

      `none` sends traffic directly to the game server. If configured, `network_mode` must equal `host`. Read more about host networking [here](https://rivet.gg/docs/dynamic-servers/concepts/host-bridge-networking). Only available on Rivet Open Source & Enterprise.
    enum:
      - none
      - game_guard

  Captcha:
    docs: Matchmaker captcha configuration.
    properties:
      requests_before_reverify:
        docs: >-
          Denotes how many requests a connection can make before it is required
          to reverify a captcha.
        type: integer
      verification_ttl:
        docs: >-
          Denotes how long a connection can continue to reconnect without having
          to reverify a captcha (in milliseconds).
        type: long

        type: optional<string>
      secret_key:
        docs: Secret key for your hCaptcha application. Must be set.
        type: optional<string>

  CaptchaHcaptchaLevel:
    docs: |
      **Deprecated**
      How hard a captcha should be.
    enum:
      - easy
      - moderate
      - difficult
      - always_on

  CaptchaTurnstile:
    docs: Turnstile captcha configuration.
    properties:
      site_key: string
      secret_key: string

  NetworkMode:
    docs: >-
      Configures how the container's network is isolated from the host.

      `bridge` (default) networking isolates the container's network from the host & other containers.

      `host` networking removes isolation between the container and the host. Only available in Rivet Open Source & Enterprise.

    enum:
      - bridge
