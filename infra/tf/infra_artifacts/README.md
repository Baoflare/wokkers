# infra-artifacts

Used to store assets required within the infrastructure. At the moment, this is only used for storing Rust
executables that are ran on servers.

This should not be used for anything that runs within Kubernetes, those can be built and uploaded to Docker.
This is intended for Docker-less environments.
